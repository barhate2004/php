Design a HTML form to accept two numbers. Write a PHP script to find maximum number from
them and assign -1 to it. Also display both the numbers. (Pass parameters by reference method and
return by reference)
<!doctype html>
<head>
<body>
<form action="B2.php" method="POST">
Enter Number 1 : <input type="number" name="n1"><br><br>
Enter Number 2 : <input type="number" name="n2"><br><br>
<input type="submit">
</form>
</body>
</html>
