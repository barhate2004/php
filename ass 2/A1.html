Design a HTML form to accept two numbers and arithmetic operation to be performed from the
user. Write a PHP script to perform arithmetic operations on the operands given by the user and
display the result of the operation. (Use the concept of function and default parameters. Use
â€—include construct or require statement)
<!doctype html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>OPERATIONS</h1><br><br>
<form action="A1.php" method="POST">
Enter Int 1 : <input type="number" name="n1">
Enter Int 2 : <input type="number" name="n2">
<input type="submit">
</form>
</body>
</html>
